  "body": "### Background.\r\nOne of my favorite games of all time is Dig Dug.  When I was a young child, my mother would give me a handful of quarters to pacify me while she did the grocery shopping at the local Kroger - Savon.  I still have fond memories of that beautiful arcade machine located next to the carpet shampoo machines for rent kiosk.\r\nI have no experience with programming, but I'm eager - that must account for something; right?\r\n### Obstacles\r\nI believe Namco has a pretty significant IP patent on this game, so a big challenge will be creating something that gives the \"feel\" of the original game without infringing on Namco's original design.\r\n### Programming Languages to Consider\r\nI'm intrigued by the possibility of using the Unreal Engine, Swift, Android, etc. because they're all open source.  I really want to create a mobile application/game, since I believe this is one of the fastest growing segments of mobile apps./gaming industry.\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGrover Peters @3Grover3 is the lone wolf/author/contributor for this project.  However, I will definitely need to partner with other more talented individuals in order to get this to market before the end of the world as we know it.\r\n### Closing\r\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions, I would love to hear from you. \r\n",
