<p>One of my favorite games of all time is Dig Dug.  When I was a young child, my mother would give me a handful of quarters to pacify me while she did the grocery shopping at the local Kroger - Savon.  I still have fond memories of that beautiful arcade machine located next to the carpet shampoo machines for rent kiosk.
I have no experience with programming, but I'm eager - that must account for something; right?</p>

<p>I believe Namco has a pretty significant IP patent on this game, so a big challenge will be creating something that gives the "feel" of the original game without infringing on Namco's original design.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the possibility of using the Unreal Engine, Swift, Android, etc. because they're all open source.  I really want to create a mobile application/game, since I believe this is one of the fastest growing segments of mobile apps./gaming industry.</p>

<p>Grover Peters <a href="https://github.com/3Grover3" class="user-mention">@3Grover3</a> is the lone wolf/author/contributor for this project.  However, I will definitely need to partner with other more talented individuals in order to get this to market before the end of the world as we know it.</p>
